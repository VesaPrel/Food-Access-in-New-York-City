# Food Access in New York City
### Kayla Ortega, Rune Baldwin, Mia Katić, Daphne Buckley and Vesa Prelvukaj

In many parts of New York City, especially low-income neighborhoods, residents face limited access to affordable, nutritious food, in locations known as food deserts, which lack supermarkets and access to fresh produce and grains, leading to convenience stores and fast-food becoming many households’ primary food source. This issue contributed to significant health risks, such as obesity, diabetes and heart disease—all of which disproportionately affect  low-income areas and neighborhoods within the city.

Our project aims to explore the causes/impacts of food deserts and food accessibility in NYC, and analyze the underlying systemic issues like redlining which persist the lack of supermarkets in high-traffic, low-income areas in the city.
Using interactive maps, census and health data and visualizations, we intend to show the relationship between food access and socioeconomic patterns in NYC. Through analytical comparison, we can see how urban development, gentrification, and policy decisions (zoning laws and redlining) have influenced where and how people can access healthy food.
By understanding where and why these disparities exist, we—as a city and as a community—can fight for equitable food access across all boroughs.

# Methods

● Create an ArcGIS StoryMap that compares and analyses the kind of supermarkets and food easily available to the residents of each area/neighborhood/borough.

● In the StoryMap, we will summarize the project’s goal, supply context, and demonstrate how the provided visuals, statistics and information can be useful to the public through our own example that demonstrates our hypothesis as to why certain areas of NYC have a wider range of staple foods than others.

● Include a slide presentation within the StoryMap which fleshes out area descriptions and geographic factors that impact food availability

● Describe how we created our storymap + presentation on our Github site
